# 📅 Day 56 – GFG 160 Days DSA Challenge
### 🔍 Problem: Subarray with Given Sum
### 🧠 Difficulty: Medium
### 📌 Tags: #Day56 #gfg160 #geekstreak2025
### 🚀 Status: Solved in 1 Attempt ✅

## 📋 Problem Statement:
Given an array of non-negative integers, find a continuous subarray that adds up to a given target sum.

## ⚙️ Approach Used: Sliding Window Technique
💡 Insight:

- Since all elements are non-negative, we can use the sliding window technique efficiently to maintain a running sum and shrink the window from the left when necessary.

## 📊 Submission Summary:
- ✅ Test Cases Passed: 1112 / 1112

- 🧪 Accuracy: 100%

- ⏱️ Time Taken: 0.2 sec

- 🏆 Points Scored: 4 / 4

- 📈 Total Score: 205


## 🔎 Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(n)

- Space Complexity: O(1)

## 🌱 Learning Outcome:
Leveraged sliding window to avoid brute-force O(n²) checks and achieved an elegant linear-time solution for subarray sum detection.
